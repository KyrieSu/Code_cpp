Assignment 03 - the Enigma
===================

Please read "Intro_Enigma.pptx" first and figure out the secret behind the Enigma carefully.

Extend the example codes (Enigma.h & Enigma_Base.h) and provide your own version of Enigma encoder. This program should encode string from a file (original_data.txt) and output *encoded* string to a file, too. (encoded_data.txt).

Please follow the example code and create derived class for each component of Enigma.

A win32 executable program has been provide in the ./example/TAsEnigma.exe. Also, a referenced Main.cpp has been provided, too.

Due date:  5/14 (Thu.)

----------
A common workflow of preparation of your homework (UPDATED)
-------------
(In the following text, we assume your student ID is s1234567 and # is the NUMBER of homework in one digit, Please replace it with your student ID and follow the steps exactly!)


1. Clone your private repository of hw# to your home directory on server or another suitable location from our organization on GitHub (https://github.com/YZU-CSE-CS114-Computer-Programming-II)


2. After you start to deal with your homework, add a file s1234567hw#_main.cpp as your main program and s1234567hw#_report.md as your report (optional). Then, commit it! **(Don't forget to push it onto GitHub, too)** 
**Any of your code should be prefixed with "1234567hw#_"**.
**For example: s1234567hw3_ HugeUInteger.h, s1234567hw3_ HugeUInteger.cpp**


3. Complete your program and write your report (if necessary) with Markdown.
*. Please commit your homework when you have any progress.


4. Make sure you have complete the assignment and prepare a clear demo in your report. **Do it ON YOUR OWN and ON TIME.** (You have **only 2 chances in this semester** to request additional time for doing your homework, each chance will give you additional **24Hours**. Please contact the TAs **BEFORE** the deadline and use it wisely)
